# 1 Define a class which has at least two methods: getString: to get a string from console input printString: to print the string in upper case.

# class StrToUpper:
#     def __init__(self):
#         self.string = ""
#     def get_string(self):
#         self.string = input("Введите строку: ")
#     def printString(self):
#         print(self.string.upper())

# some_string = StrToUpper()
# some_string.get_string()
# some_string.printString()




# 2 Define a class named Shape and its subclass Square. The Square class has an init function which takes a length as argument. Both classes have a area function which can print the area of the shape where Shape's area is 0 by default.

# class Shape:
#     def __init__(self, length):
#         self.length = length
#     def area(self):
#         return 0
    
# class Square(Shape):
#     def __init__(self, length):
#         super().__init__(length)

#     def area(self):
#         print(self.length * self.length)

# sq = Square(3)
# sq.area()




# 3 Define a class named Rectangle which inherits from Shape class from task 2. Class instance can be constructed by a length and width. The Rectangle class has a method which can compute the area.

# class Shape:
#     def __init__(self, length, width):
#         self.length = length
#         self.width = width
#     def area(self):
#         return 0

# class Rectangle(Shape):
#     def __init__(self, length, width):
#         super().__init__(length, width)
        
#     def area(self):
#         print(self.length * self.width)
        
# rc = Rectangle(3, 4)
# rc.area()
